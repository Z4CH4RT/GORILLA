How to Run:

Install Node.js and WebSocket:
npm install ws
Run the Server:
Save the server-side code as server.js.
Run node server.js.
Run the Client:
Save the client-side code as an .html file.
Replace "your_game.zip" with your game's URL.
Open the HTML file in your browser.
Testing:
Open the HTML page in two different browser windows.
Any key press in one window will send that input to the server, and the server will then broadcast the new game state to all clients.
Important:
This code only sends the key presses to the server. Actual game state changes inside of js-dos are not implemented. This is a very complex process, and will need to be implemented based on your game.
Key Points:

This is a very basic example.
Latency will be significant.
Game state synchronization within the js-dos environment is not fully implemented.
This code is very basic, and will need to be modified based on your game.
Security has not been implemented.
Error handling should be improved.
